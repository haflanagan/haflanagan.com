Hi!  I'm a museum educator, writer, and permaculture enthusiast living in Red Hook, Brooklyn, NY.


Permaculture is a design approach for creating sustainable human communities. It was originally conceived as a way to create productive agricultural landscapes modeled on natural ecosystems: "permanent" + "agriculture" = "permaculture"


Since its development in the 1970s, though, practitioners have used permaculture principles to make many other aspects of our society more sustainable, including "buildings, energy and wastewater systems, villages, and even less tangible structures such as school curricula, businesses, community groups, and decision-making processes." (These examples come from Toby Hemenway's Gaia's Garden, a truly excellent beginner's guide to the topic.)


I love permaculture because it emphasizes observing, understanding, and embracing a place (both the environment and the people in it) in order to work in harmony with its unique qualities, rather than imposing a top-down, decontextualized vision.  As someone with an education background, I liken it to a student-centered classroom where the teacher facilitates the inquiry and exploration of the class, rather than disseminating information into so many "empty vessels."

It's my belief that through permaculture we can create communities that are respectful to the environment and socially just.

But, as always, implementation is the trickiest part!  Part of what I try to navigate in my lifestyle and writing is the web of interconnections that come from living in a global society.  I think one of the challenges people face when they try to "be sustainable" is that it's such a complex, multi-faceted topic.  Even when you're making an honest effort, there are a lot of lingering questions!  Who picked your organically grown tomatoes, and were they paid a fair wage?  What are your American-made clothes made out of, and what happens to them after you put them in a donation bin?  Where is your local artisanal _ maker sourcing their energy?

It's tempting to stay out of the mess entirely, but I think that the more we try to wrap our heads around the issues, and the more voices we invite into the discussion, the more able we'll be to find collective solutions to our problems.

On my end, I've approached this in a couple of different ways:

* Reading broadly to understand social justice issues
* Reading broadly to understand environmental issues
* Systematically investigating and researching the consumer products and behaviors I engage with/in to look for alternatives
* Observing the physical and cultural landscape of my neighborhood/city
* Experimenting with permaculturist methods to grow site-specific plant species

I've created a few digital projects over the past five years to document various aspects of this work.  One is Plantblr, which I've described as my "uncreatively named" tumblr cataloging the plant species I've grown/am growing(!).  Another is Weeds of Red Hook, a tumblr I use to capture weeds I see growing in my neighborhood along with a quick note about their potential uses.  At the moment I'm gathering up material for another tumblr that will probably be called something like Sustainable Versions of Things, where I highlightâ€¦sustainable versions of things.  (Admittedly I have an Amelia Bedelia-like sensibility when it comes to naming things.)

I'm always up for learning more, so if you have a media recommendation or you'd like to chat, let me know!  You can reach me on Twitter @haflanagan.  Thanks for reading!

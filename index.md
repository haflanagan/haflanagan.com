New York, NY (3/2016 - Present)

1. **Digital Learning Specialist** (7/2017- Present)

1. **Communications and Curriculum Editor** (3/2016- 7/2017)


The Billion Oyster Project (BOP) is an ecosystem restoration and education project aimed at restoring one billion live oysters to New York Harbor and engaging hundreds of thousands of school children through restoration-based STEM education programs.

#### Digital Learning Specialist

Developed and managed an open source data collection and analysis web application that NYC students, teachers, and community scientists use to submit and analyze restoration science data, create curriculum, and present original research. In this capacity, I am responsible for both the overall product vision and strategy as well as implementation. Development is carried out both directly by me (frontend coding and data modelling) and through
pro-bono technical talent for backend and operations.

Additionally, I create trainings, curriculum, and educational resources to teach educators the technology side of doing field-based scientific research with their students. I was also a founding member of our
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee.

#### Communications and Curriculum Editor

I trained educators on how to do field-based scientific research with their students, wrote standards-aligned middle school STEM curriculum, and created digital educational resources and content to support Billion
Oyster Project's education-through-restoration work. This included long-form blog posts, readings for students, multimedia how-to guides, a newsletter, a Tumblr, and social media posts.
